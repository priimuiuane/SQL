# SQL Projects
This repository showcases a series of SQL projects completed during my Master’s program at the University of Georgia as part of my Database Management coursework.
Each project demonstrates key database concepts, including:
Data modeling and schema design
Query optimization and data manipulation
Joins, subqueries, and aggregations
Data validation and analysis through SQL queries
The repository includes both the original assignment queries and screenshots of the executed results for reference.
